<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Project Title:</strong> <em>Visualizing Housing Market Trends: An Analysis of Sale Prices and Features using Tableau</em>
</p>

<p>
    This project focuses on uncovering key insights into the housing market by analyzing sale prices in relation to various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and year built.
</p>

<p>
    Using <strong>Tableau</strong>, we have built interactive visualizations and dashboards that help users explore and understand trends in the housing market over time. The data is visually represented through charts, graphs, maps, and storytelling dashboards that make the analysis intuitive and insightful.
</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To identify the major factors influencing house prices.</li>
    <li>To visualize how house prices vary by region and over time.</li>
    <li>To enable users to interactively explore the data and draw conclusions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools & Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flask</strong> – Python framework used to build the web application.</li>
    <li><strong>Tableau Public</strong> – Used to create and host the dashboards and storyboards.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong> – For building the front-end user interface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Tableau?</h3>
<p>
    Tableau was chosen for its powerful data visualization capabilities and ease of use. It allows for the creation of dynamic dashboards and storylines that make the data not only more accessible but also more actionable for users and stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
    Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how visual analytics can simplify complex datasets and empower better decision-making in real estate and beyond.
